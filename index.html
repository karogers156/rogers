                            <p>For this exercise, I was asked to create a map highlighting Philadelphia School Districts that had over 1,200 students enrolled and were also within 0.1 miles of a bike network. The Philadelphia School District was interested in implementing a new initiative that encourages students to bike to school, but this would not be feasible for all students. To solve this issue, we identified which school districts in Philadelphia are close to bike networks. Additionally, we only selected districts with a large number of students, as the initiative would be most impactful on districts with a large student body. This map utilizes the "Selection by Attribute" and "Selection by Location" tools, which allow us to highlight only those districts that fit our criteria.</p>

                            <p>In this lab assignment, I acted as a GIS Crime Analyst for the city of Chicago. My boss in this scenario was concerned about how murder rates in certain police districts unfairly represent the entirety of the city. These misconceptions result in political disapproval and issues with tourism. To solve this week’s problem, I used data from the City of Chicago to understand the relationship between the prevalence of homicide and tourism in Chicago. It is possible that in police districts with a higher num Some of the data was not available from dataset-to-dataset, so I created new fields from the available data to measure the homicides and Airbnb rentals by square mile. I also changed all of the shape files to a uniform projection (NAD 1983 UTM Zone 16N) that made sense given the location of Chicago. </p>

                            <p>A prevalent issue in Philadelphia is food insecurity, especially for lower-income populations in urban areas. The City wants to find a potential new location for a healthy food store to alleviate this issue. Therefore, we want to find areas that are: included in the Philadelphia Empowerment Zones which receive targeted investments, within walking distance of a subway or regional rail station, and are not close to “competitors” or other stores that could limit the need for an additional store in the area. We can prove our case more easily if we identify an area within an empowerment zone, as the City would be providing program-qualified investments if they supported the development of a new store. We are more likely to receive approval and funding for a new location if it is within walking distance to public transportation, since many lower-income Philadelphians depend on public transport to access healthy grocery stores. Additionally, we are less likely to receive approval/funding if there are already healthy food stores in the area that are receiving governmental investments, as this may be seen as a waste of money and resources due to lower demand. To find these areas, we use different GIS tools (buffer, union, intersect) that highlight areas within the empowerment zones that are within walking distance to a public transit station and are not near competing stores.</p>
